Robotics is the field that focuses on designing, building, and controlling machines that can sense, think, and act in the physical world
      A robot is more than just a machine that moves; it combines mechanical parts, electronics, and intelligence to perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance.
        The goal of robotics is to create systems that can assist, replace, or enhance human effort.

Robots rely on sensors to understand their surroundings and actuators, such as motors, to interact with the environment. 
Using control systems and algorithms, they process sensor information and decide how to move or respond. 
Because the real world is often uncertain and changing, robots must be able to adapt to different situations rather than follow fixed instructions.

Today, robotics is used in many areas, including manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, and everyday services.
 As robots become more advanced, they are increasingly capable of working safely alongside humans, performing complex tasks, and operating in environments that are difficult or dangerous for people.
