Each month, developers merged 43 million pull requests — a 23% increase from the prior year in one of the main ways teams propose and review changes to their code. The annual number of commits pushed, which track those changes, jumped 25% year-over-year to 1 billion. The unprecedented pace signals a major shift in the industry as AI becomes increasingly central to how software is built and improved.\\n\\nMario Rodriguez, GitHub’s chief product officer, says that sheer volume is why 2026 will bring a new edge: “repository intelligence.” In plain terms, it means AI that understands not just lines of code but the relationships and history behind them. [...] ## AI will become central to the research process\\n\\n AI is already speeding up breakthroughs in fields like climate modeling, molecular dynamics and materials design, says Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research. But the next leap is coming. In 2026, AI won’t just summarize papers, answer questions and write reports — it will actively join the process of discovery in physics, chemistry and biology.\\n\\n“AI will generate hypotheses, use tools and apps that control scientific experiments, and collaborate with both human and AI research colleagues,” Lee says.',\n",

       "  'content': '2024 ended on a high note for open-source AI with Meta’s Llama models gaining traction. Since then, the open-source AI ecosystem has grown a lot, with smaller, domain-specific models achieving impressive results—it’s the case for IBM’s Granite, Ai2’s Olmo 3 and, of course, DeepSeek’s models. Anthony Annunziata, Director of Open Source AI at IBM and the AI Alliance, sees this trend accelerating in 2026.\\n\\n“We’re going to see smaller reasoning models that are multimodal and easier to tune for specific domains,” he said during an interview with IBM Think. [...] After much skepticism around AI’s ROI, AI capabilities will pave new ways to do business in the enterprise. And open-source reasoning models and agents will keep pushing boundaries to conquer enterprise AI.\\n\\nAt the same time, trust and security will become key priorities as many enterprises sharpen their focus on AI sovereignty.\\n\\nThat’s just the opening act for what’s to come in enterprise tech in the days ahead. Read on for 18 expert predictions to watch out for in 2026.\\n\\nIndustry newsletter\\n\\n### The latest AI trends, brought to you by experts\\n\\nGet curated insights on the most important—and intriguing—AI news.

[...] 2026 will be defined by three trends that move AI beyond personal productivity, says Kevin Chung, Chief Strategy Officer at Writer, an enterprise AI platform for agentic work.\\n\\n“First, AI is shifting from individual usage to team and workflow orchestration,” Chung told IBM Think. That means coordinating entire workflows, connecting data across departments and moving projects from idea to completion.\\n\\nSecond, as reasoning capabilities improve, systems won’t just follow instructions: they’ll anticipate needs. “This evolution transforms AI from a passive assistant into an active collaborator capable of meaningful problem-solving and decision-making,” he said.',\n",

       " 'generation': 'Birds fly when the forces they create, specifically lift and thrust, are greater than the forces acting upon them, namely weight and drag. They use their wings to create these physical forces that allow them to fly, with lift being the vertical force that keeps them aloft and thrust propelling them forward. This is made possible by their lightweight bodies, well-developed chest muscles, and specially shaped feathers.',\n",
       " 'documents': [Document(metadata={}, page_content='Even if you attached wings to yourself with the hope of flying, you unfortunately would not be able to. That is because the secret to how birds fly is not only in their feathers but also in their body.  \\nFirstly, there are the muscles. The muscles in the chest required for a bird to flap its wings are very well developed. In some birds, the muscles in the chest alone account for more than one quarter of its body weight. (The proportion in humans is said to be one one-hundredth.)  \\nAnd, their bodies are lightweight; the Japanese White-eye, which is smaller than a sparrow, weighs a mere 10 grams the weight of several postcards. [...] Birds have feathers on their wings, called “primary feathers,” which help them fly forward. Primary feathers have a difference in width on the right side and the left side of the shaft; the narrow side is the front and the wide side is the back. Since airflow is pushed toward the back by the wide side when the wings flap downward, thrust is created, enabling the bird to fly forward.  \\nIf you find a primary feather, try an experiment with your family or friends. Two people stand facing each other, and one person holds both hands up with their palms facing. The other person holds the feather horizontally pointing outward, and with a movement like waving a palm fan, brings the feather straight down between their partner\\'s hands. [...] Birds are ready to fly at any moment in order to escape from predators or to catch prey. It is essential for them to preen their feathers in order to also remove mites, ticks, and other parasites.  \\nBirds are often seen “bathing.” Many birds take a quick bath in shallow water, such as a puddle, by rustling their feathers a few times. (It\\'s such a short time that people who just take a quick shower, are often said to “take a bird bath.”)   \\nSwallows bathe while flying, and Brown-eared Bulbuls and Common Kingfishers bathe by diving into water. If you see a bird bathing, watch as it shakes the water off after coming out and then repositions its feathers with its bill.\\nbird in the earth’s gravity. We are all too familiar with the force of weight. The second, drag, is the frictional force created by the movement of air over the plumage. Drag is the force of resistance that acts to impede the forward motion of the bird through the air. (Humans experience drag while riding in a motorcycle or a convertible with the top down, or swimming.) The bird itself creates two other forces with its wings: lift, the vertical, aerodynamic force that keeps the bird aloft, and thrust, which propels the bird forward in the air. How do birds exploit these forces to fly? In brief, birds fly when the forces they create—lift and thrust—are greater than the forces acting upon them—weight and drag. But how do birds create lift and thrust? Clearly, that is what all that flapping [...] for flight, and the depth of his appreciation for the complexity of avian flight. Last, I will attempt to characterize Leonardo’s singular role in the history of science in general and ornithology in particular. How Birds Fly Birds use their wings to create the physical forces that allow them to fly. The description of this process is called aerodynamics. To understand how birds create aerodynamic forces, we need to discuss the anatomy of the avian wing. The bird’s wing is a vertebrate forelimb. Like the human arm, it has characteristic skeletal elements—a single basal upper arm bone attached to a pair of parallel bones followed by a proliferation of smaller bones in the hand and fingers (fig. 32). In addition to the wing bones having special shapes, and greatly reduced fingers, the bird [...] to be traveling faster across the top surface of the wing than across the bottom. It is the differences in air speeds over the surfaces of the wing that create the forces that allow birds to fly. Bernoulli’s Law, named after mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1781) who rediscovered many of Leonardo’s insights into fluid dynamics, helps us to understand the consequences of these differences in air speed over the surfaces of the wing. Bernoulli states that the sum of the static air pressure acting downward on a surface and the dynamic air pressure acting along a surface are constant. Thus, the faster the dynamic pressure, or air speed, the lower the static pressure, and vice versa. The Bernoulli effect can be observed by holding the edge of a small sheet of paper to your bottom lip; when\\nAerial locomotion in avian dinosaurs\\n\\nBird flight is the primary mode of locomotion used by most bird species in which birds take off and fly. Flight assists birds with feeding, breeding, avoiding predators, and migrating.\\n\\nBird flight includes multiple types of motion, including hovering, taking off, and landing, involving many complex movements. As different bird species adapted over millions of years through evolution for specific environments, prey, predators, and other needs, they developed specializations in their wings \"Wing (bird)\"), and acquired different forms of flight. [...] ### Uses and loss of flight in modern birds\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nBirds use flight to obtain prey on the wing, for foraging, to commute to feeding grounds, and to migrate between the seasons. It is also used by some species to display during the breeding season and to reach safe isolated places for nesting.\\n\\nFlight is more energetically expensive in larger birds, and many of the largest species fly by soaring and gliding (without flapping their wings) as much as possible. Many physiological adaptations have evolved that make flight more efficient. [...] The most obvious adaptation to flight is the wing, but because flight is so energetically demanding birds have evolved several other adaptations to improve efficiency when flying. Birds\\' bodies are streamlined to help overcome air-resistance. Also, the bird skeleton is hollow to reduce weight, and many unnecessary bones have been lost (such as the bony tail of the early bird Archaeopteryx), along with the toothed jaw of early birds, which has been replaced with a lightweight beak. The skeleton\\'s breastbone has also adapted into a large keel, suitable for the attachment of large, powerful flight muscles. The vanes of each feather have hooklets called barbules that zip the vanes of individual feathers together, giving the feathers the strength needed to hold the airfoil (these are often\\nLater, more refined feather shapes could begin to also provide lift. Uses and loss of flight in modern birds Birds use flight to obtain prey on the wing, for foraging, to commute to feeding grounds, and to migrate between the seasons. It is also used by some species to display during the breeding season and to reach safe isolated places for nesting. Flight is more energetically expensive in larger birds, and many of the largest species fly by soaring and gliding (without flapping their wings) most of the time. Many physiological adaptations have evolved that make flight more efficient. Birds that settle on isolated oceanic islands that lack ground-based predators often lose the ability to fly.

As feathers became elongated, perhaps for display, they became more suitable to support flight.  See Wikipedia for detailed discussion.See a New Theory of Bird Flight and Theory of Bird Flight Linked to Parental Care. Most adaptations a bird has for flight are based on two basic factors- increased power and decreased weight. To have both the power and the lightness needed to fly, there have been a number of structural modifications in both the muscular and skeletal system: [...] and they soar around in circles. As the wind exceeds 14kph, these vertical columns of air are blown horizontal and birds soar in a straight line. They will soar into the wind to gain altitude and then lose altitude to gain distance. The birds control soaring/gliding speeds and altitude by spreading or pulling in their wings to increase or reduce lift. [...] We often admire soaring birds; soaring is essentially coasting downhill on a current of air. Birds stay aloft by riding rising air currents. Obstruction currents are updrafts caused by the deflection of a horizontal wind upward by a cliff, hillside, ocean wave, etc. Convection currents (thermals) are updrafts of warm air caused by the sun heating the ground; the ground reradiates the heat which warms the air above it, causing it to rise. (When you see vultures soaring, it doesn’t mean there’s something dead, only that they’re soaring on air currents.) Over the ocean, when the breezes are under 14kph in the fall, the water, being warmer than the air, produces vertical currents of rising warm air on which the birds ride and they soar around in circles.

       "{'question': 'How dogs drink water',\n",
       " 'generation': 'Dogs drink water by curling their tongues backward, shaping like a ladle, and scooping water, which creates a column of water that feeds into their mouths. As they take their tongues out of the water, they create an acceleration of roughly five times that of gravity. The dog then closes its mouth around the top of the water column to maximize the amount of liquid.',\n",
       " 'documents': Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Until the next year, when Harvard researchers X-rayed dogs drinking and realized that they were doing what cats did — albeit in a messier way. “We conclude that cats and dogs share the same basic mechanism,” they wrote. “Liquid adheres to the dorsal surface of the backwardly curled tongue tip.”\\n\\nWhat about the water the dog scoops into its backwards ladle? That water ends up underneath the dog’s tongue — a problem for pooches, since water must be above the tongue to be swallowed. “For humans, if you have water underneath your tongue, you can close your mouth and just push the water above your tongue,” Jung says. Not so for cheekless dogs — that water simply dribbles out. [...] So why do dogs bother to curl their tongues at all? In 2015, researchers at Purdue University and Virginia Tech, including Jung, took a closer look. They filmed 19 dogs drinking, from a Yorkshire Terrier mix to a Great Dane, and modeled their drinking using rounded glass rods.\\n\\nThe team realized dogs’ curled tongues let them drink more water. “If you have a bigger object pulling out of the water, then a large column of water is formed, [and] if you want to make a bigger structure, you're going to curve your tongue and make a very round shape,” says Jung. [...] In other words, a dog’s curled tongue becomes a kind of piston, which punches the water with a larger area, pulling more water into the mouth. The dog closes its mouth around the top of the water column at just the right time to maximize the amount of liquid — 1 or 2 milliliters per lap, the team found.\\n\\nThere’s another difference between dogs and cats. “With the cat, you’re going to see a little deceleration just before they pull their tongue [into] the mouth,” says Jung. “But if you look at the dog, they maintain their acceleration for a longer time.” A bigger, faster-moving piston makes for a bigger mess.\\n\\nJung isn’t sure why dogs and cats do things a little differently. “Maybe it's due to the nature of the animal,” he says. “The cats, they hate water.”\\n## The Difference Between Cat and Dog Drinking\\n\\nCats drink neatly as they place their tongues on the water and pull it up, catching the resulting stream of water with their tongue. Dogs, on the other hand, drink by hitting the water with their tongues. When they take their tongues out of the water, they create an incredible acceleration—roughly five times that of gravity—that creates water columns that then feed up into their mouths.\\n\\n## How Dogs Drink [...] ## How Dogs Drink\\n\\n“Dogs curl their tongues backward, shaping like a ladle,” says lead researcher Dr. Sunghwan Jung, assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics at Virginia Tech. “Then, their tongues will scoop some water and also create a column of water beneath. Dogs bite and drink a portion of this water column, but scooped water will fall back to the bath.” Hence, all the splashing.\\n\\n“All breeds of dogs drink the same way, but their anatomy plays a role in how messy they are when they drink,” says Dr. Gaylord Brown, the in-house veterinarian at Delta Rescue in Glendale, Cali. “A large, heavy jowled dog will, by his anatomy, have more drool than a Chihuahua. However, the actual drinking process is the same.”\\n\\n## How to Handle the Mess [...] ## How Much Should a Dog Drink?\\n\\nAs for how much a dog should be drinking per day, a lot of that depends on his level of activity as well as the kind of food he eats, says Dr. Brown. “A dog should have about one ounce of water per pound of body weight per day,” he says. “This varies with temperature, activity and diet. Those dogs who eat canned food only will tend to drink less because the canned food is up to 70 percent water. In the heat, water consumption can triple, due to panting for temperature control. Similarly, exercise can triple or quadruple the water need, depending on the length of exercise and the temperature.”\\nMeasurements of water intake were made on a population of trained conscious dogs of both sexes prepared with chronic third ventricle cannulae. 2. Injection of 100 ng angiotensin II into the third ventricle lead to a prompt stimulation of drinking, the mean water intake over a 5 min period being 503 +/- 89 ml. (n=6) compared with controls. This dipsogenic effect of angiotensin II was abolished by prior central administration of 10 mug saralasin acetate or 100 ng atropine. 3. Injection of 1 mug carbachol into the third ventricle produced a small, variable increase in drinking. 4. Injection of 0-2 ml. 5% NaCl into the third ventricle stimulated drinking, a response that was not affected by prior administration of 10 mug saralasin acetate or 100 ng atropine. 5. Following a 24 hr period of [...] acetate or 100 ng atropine. 5. Following a 24 hr period of water deprivation there was an increase in plasma osmolality and plasma-renin activity. The drinking following this period of water deprivation was not affected by prior control administration of either 10 mug saralasin acetate or 100 ng atropine. 6. In two acute dogs, intracarotid infusion of 125I angiotensin II was not followed by significant appearance of radioactivity in the third ventricle or cisterna magna c.s.f. 7. The relevance of these results to the control of water intake is discussed.\\n### Compulsive Drinking\\n\\nSome dogs develop compulsive behaviors, including excessive drinking, as a result of underlying anxiety or obsessive-compulsive tendencies. This behavior can become problematic if it leads to water intoxication or disrupts their normal routine. If your dog seems to be drinking water excessively and without apparent reason, monitor their behavior closely. If the drinking seems to be out of control, consult with your veterinarian at Pet Townsend Veterinary Clinic to rule out medical causes and discuss potential behavioral interventions.\\n\\n## When to Seek Veterinary Care for Excessive Thirst [...] ### Kidney Disease\\n\\nThe kidneys play a crucial role in filtering waste from the bloodstream and maintaining fluid balance. When the kidneys aren’t functioning properly, your dog may drink more water as their body struggles to eliminate toxins. In addition to excessive thirst, symptoms of kidney disease may include increased urination, decreased appetite, vomiting, and weight loss.\\n\\n### Cushing’s Disease\\n\\nCushing’s disease, or hyperadrenocorticism, occurs when the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol. Elevated cortisol levels affect the kidneys’ ability to concentrate urine, leading to increased urination and, subsequently, an increase in water consumption. This condition can lead to a variety of symptoms, including increased thirst, excessive panting, and a pot-bellied appearance. [...] ### Diabetes Mellitus\\n\\nDiabetes mellitus is a condition where the body cannot effectively regulate blood sugar levels. When blood sugar levels are high, the kidneys work harder to remove the excess sugar, leading to more frequent urination. As a result, your dog may drink more water to compensate for the loss of fluids. This is one of the early signs of diabetes in dogs. If your dog is also showing symptoms such as increased urination, weight loss, or lethargy, consult with your veterinarian.\\n\\n### Kidney Disease\\n## How much water should my dog or cat drink?\\n\\nTextbooks define normal water intake as 1-2ml per kilogram of bodyweight per hour (equivalent to approximately 25-50ml/kg/24hrs). For example, a 10kg dog, like a Westie, would be expected to drink approximately 480ml (just under a pint) in 24 hours. Marked variation can be seen between individuals, dependent on the amount of water taken in with their food (wet vs dry food), and water lost through exercise and panting.\\n\\n## What is Polydipsia?\\n\\nPolydipsia (increased drinking) is defined as more than 100ml per kg per day. [...] In these circumstances, the thirst centre in the brain is also triggered to stimulate drinking. Increased drinking can occur either because the concentrating mechanisms of the kidneys fail, the kidneys do not respond to ADH, ADH is not produced or released, or because there is an excessive stimulus to drinking (primary polydipsia).\\n\\n### What are the most common causes of my dog or cat drinking more?\\n\\nThe causes of an increase in the consumption of water in your pet can be varied. The kind of causes we see are:\\n\\nIf you are worried about your pet’s fluid intake, it can be helpful to measure their water intake over a 24 hour period and pass this information on to your vet, along with a fresh urine sample, ideally collected first thing in the morning. [...] Some pets may have noticeably increased drinking, whilst still drinking less than this amount. More than 50ml/kg/24hrs may raise suspicion about polydipsia, whereas over 100ml/kg/24hrs is definitely polydipsia. Polyuria refers to an abnormally high urine production.\\n\\nIf you think your cat or dog is drinking too much water, please call our Drewsbury practice on 01924 465592 or find your local Calder vets practice here.\\n\\n### Why is my dog or cat drinking so much water?\\n\\nWater balance is tightly controlled by the body through regulation of water intake and water loss in the urine. Lack of water intake or excessive water loss causes the pituitary gland in the brain to release “anti-diuretic hormone” (ADH). ADH signals the kidneys to conserve water and to concentrate the urine.\")}"

It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.
